It is a lot of content to digest tbh but yes very practical and useful insights on human conversations and how real life negotiations are affected by small changes in choice of words and tone of your voice. The concepts of mirroring, rapport building, Starting with a \"No\", open ended questions and making the other party think and think just blew up my mind especially  when they were suported by real life cases. Though a lot of practical knowledge it is waste until not practiced enough as all of it highly depends on the delivery of the person. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to understand the dynamics of deal making and negotiations."

The way characters are weaved, it is the best I've seen so far. Murakami describes every scene in words so vividly that you start to have a strong visual of the place in your head as if you were there watching everything happen in front of your own eyes. The evening when Watanabe and Midori sat there on the terrace watching a fire in her neighbourhood or when Watanabe visits Naoko in her sanatorium I feel as if these are my own memories. "
