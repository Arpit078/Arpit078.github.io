The idea is to have the main page house the recommendor then the second page the books you‚Äôve read, a page with reviews about them in form of blog posts which can be shared just like you can share your spotify playlists using urls. Finally a third page where you can upload your own epubs and mobi to read, the app will track your progress, keep updating your reading status on your public profile, which houses (already mentioned) reviews. Share your reading status and past reads with your friends. Recommendor gives you options to add past reads, your current mood for your next read and any biases you would like for the choice for example similar to reads suggestions by some great personalities like bill gates or elon musk."

My head was spinning I had been testing the application for a while now but it worked for hours and hours on end. That night I was sold on the idea I‚Äôd be working on fixing the bug for the whole night. I tried everything ‚Äúmaybe the PMUs not working right ? change it‚Äù, ‚ÄúMaybe we have missed locking some common resource somewhere and the application is not thread safe and literally out of desperation I sprinkled mutex anywhere and everywhere I could think of‚Äù , ‚ÄúMaybe there is some error in the buffer to hex function and spent an hour trying several different iterations and AI models to fix up the issue all these possibilities because all that Visual studio could give as error was {an exception occured: Accessing memmory without permission} or something along similar lines.‚Äù and finally when I was about to give up I went out for a walk, One possiblity came to my mind - what the fucking if there are losses in the lan cable on the pc I was testing the application on!!. and bang that hit the bullseye. When I came back to the lab one of my good friend, team member came in as well and boi that we solved the bug in minutes. We basically had missed adding error handling for cases when the received data buffer was null and the software was trying to parse empty buffer/data arrays.
