Since the program runs an infinite loop to accept data from the PMU continuously, you cannot process anything else. This was the major issue was that we could not run execute the sendCloseCommand function and stop the communication on our command. Thus implemented a 3 thread program that accepts data from three pmu and receives user commands on the main thread."
